This is the README for pam_athena_locker, a PAM session module which 
attaches the user's home directory in pam_open_session.  This is useful 
for handling Athena home directories that are not in the home cell of 
the machine.

One uses the module by adding the line

session    optional   pam_athena_locker.so 

in /etc/pam.d/common-session after pam_krb5.so.

It supports the debug option.
